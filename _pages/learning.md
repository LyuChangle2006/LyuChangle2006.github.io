I was admitted to School of Gifted Young, USTC at fall 2022. In the freshman year, I found myself interested in mathematics, especially in geometry and topology. During this year, I learned about basic course in mathematics, including real analysis, complex analysis, point set topology and classical differential geometry.   
Based on the excellent grade that I obtained in the math course, I was chosen to join the Hua Loo-Keng Talent Program in Mathematics. In the second year of undergraduate, I focused more on the learning in geometry, auditing many courses including smooth manifold and Riemannian geometry. I also learned about some graduate-level courses, such as complex geometry, Riemannian surface and Morse theory etc.(For notes, see [Resources](https://lyuchangle2006.github.io/Resources/))
