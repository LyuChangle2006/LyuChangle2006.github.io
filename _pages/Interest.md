Music
======

I listen to a variety of music and I'm mainly interested in Hip-Hop music, experimental music and rock music. I'm a huge fan of JPEGMAFIA(aka Devon Hendryx). He makes great experimental hip-hop music and can drive many other genres. His collaborate album with Danny Brown 'SCARING THE HOES' is my album of 2023.([CHECK THIS OUT!](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Mb421b7is/?spm_id_from=333.337.search-card.all.click&vd_source=99b39d3f5c3e4d73041e7a35c1928804)). I also recommand Death Grips, Kanye West, and Ghais Guevera for more deep hip-hop music. I'm very interested in production(including samples, drums making etc.) of hip-hop music.

As for rock music, I love Pink Floyd and their famous album ['The Dark Side of the Moon'](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Du411Q7dJ/?spm_id_from=333.337.search-card.all.click). Also I recommend everyone to listen to [music by 万能青年旅店](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1yF4m1M7cV/?spm_id_from=333.337.search-card.all.click&vd_source=99b39d3f5c3e4d73041e7a35c1928804), which has the best rock music discography in Chinese industry in my opinion(although there are only two full albums lol).

I'm also a fan of Chinese traditional instruments, especially Erhu(because I myself can play this). For these are interested, I suggest George Gao's creative work in Shaoqin(韶琴), which is a huge innovation of the traditional Erhu. He combines the elements in violin greatly, and even makes the instrument plugged to do some rock music. His famous work is his series of Capriccios No.1 to No.6.
His performance of [Galloping Horse(战马奔腾)](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1ot411r7Lg/?spm_id_from=333.337.search-card.all.click) is the most viewed video of Erhu on Youtube.

Rubik's Cube
======
I started cubing about seven years ago and learned almost all the WCA events(except 5×5 blindfolded, clock and fewest move). My best level was sub9 in 3×3 cube, sub34 in 4×4 and sub68 in 5*5. My main event now is one-handed 3×3 and the training avarage is about 13s. I can also do blindfolded in 3×3 and 4×4 but I almost don't practice now.

My WCA ID is [2018LUCH02](https://cubing.com/results/person/2018LUCH02) and for my videos in cubing one can check my [bilibili homepage](https://space.bilibili.com/352062828?spm_id_from=333.1007.0.0).
