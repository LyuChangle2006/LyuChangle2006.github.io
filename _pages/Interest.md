Music
======

I listen to a variety of music and I'm mainly interested in **Hip-Hop music, experimental music and rock music**. I'm a huge fan of $${\color{brown}JPEGMAFIA(aka \space Devon \space Hendryx)}$$. He makes great experimental hip-hop music and can ride many other genres. His collaborative album with Danny Brown ***SCARING THE HOES*** is my album of 2023.([CHECK THIS OUT!](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Mb421b7is/?spm_id_from=333.337.search-card.all.click&vd_source=99b39d3f5c3e4d73041e7a35c1928804)). I also recommand _Death Grips, Kanye West, billy woods, Ka and McKinley Dixon_ for more hip-hop music. I'm very interested in production(including samples, drums, etc.) of hip-hop music.

I'm also a fan of Chinese traditional instruments, $${\color{orange}especially \space Erhu}$$, which I've played for many years. I suggest George Gao's creative work in Shaoqin(韶琴), which is a huge innovation of the traditional Erhu. He combines the elements in violin greatly, and even makes the instrument plugged to do some rock music. His famous work is his series of Capriccios No.1 to No.6.
His performance of [***Galloping Horse(战马奔腾)***](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1ot411r7Lg/?spm_id_from=333.337.search-card.all.click) is the most viewed video of Erhu on Youtube.

Rubik's Cube
======
I started cubing about seven years ago and learned almost all the WCA events(except 5×5 blindfolded, clock and fewest move). My best level $${\color{red}was}$$ **sub9 in 3×3 cube, sub34 in 4×4 and sub68 in 5×5.** My main event now is one-handed 3×3 and the training avarage is about 13s. My main event is 4×4 now. Also I am trying to pick up blindfold again.

My WCA ID is [2018LUCH02](https://cubing.com/results/person/2018LUCH02) and for my videos in cubing one can check [here](https://space.bilibili.com/352062828?spm_id_from=333.1007.0.0).

Sports
======
Table tennis is my favorite which I have been playing for many years(although very amateurishly). Sometimes I would also play badminton and tennis and go jogging.

I watch a lot of sports(including soccer, tennis and snooker, etc.) and I also follow the news in many other competitve sports. My favorite soccer team is Liverpool.
