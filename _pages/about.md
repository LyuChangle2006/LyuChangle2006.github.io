I was admitted to School of Gifted Young, USTC at fall 2022. In the freshman year, I found myself interested in mathematics, especially in geometry and topology. During this year, I learned about basic course in mathematics, including real analysis, complex analysis, point set topology and classical differential geometry.   

In the second year of undergraduate, I joined the Hua Loo-Keng Talent Program in Mathematics. And I focused more on the learning in geometry, auditing many courses including smooth manifold and Riemannian geometry. I also learned about some graduate-level courses, such as complex geometry, Riemannian surface and Morse theory etc.(For notes, see [Resources](https://lyuchangle2006.github.io/Resources/)) For more information about my learning, see [Learning Experience](https://lyuchangle2006.github.io/Learning/).  

Now I'm working on a lecture note on characteristic class theory for an expected seminar next year.

I'm also interested in music and Rubik's cube(see [Amateur Interest](https://lyuchangle2006.github.io/Interest/)).
