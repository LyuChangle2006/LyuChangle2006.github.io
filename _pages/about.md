I'm borned in April 2006 at Lu'an Anhui. I experienced high school at Gaocheng junior high school and Lu'an No.1 senior high school respectively. Now I'm a second year undergraduate student from [School of Gifted Young](https://sgy.ustc.edu.cn/), [University of Science and Technology of China](https://www.ustc.edu.cn/). I'm also a member of Hua Loo-Keng Talent Program in Mathematics of USTC. My current interest includes many aspects in geometry and topology, such as complex geometry and characteristic class theory. For more information about my learning, see [Learning Experience](https://lyuchangle2006.github.io/Learning/).  
I'm also interested in music and Rubik's cube(see [Amateur Interest](https://lyuchangle2006.github.io/Interest/).
