I was admitted to $${\color{lime}School \space of \space Gifted \space Young, \space USTC}$$ at fall 2022 and now I'm also a member of Hua Loo-Keng Talent Program in Mathematics. I am interested in ***differential geometry, especially in complex geometry, symplectic geometry and their connections with topology***. Music, Rubik's cube and table tennis are also important parts of my life.

I was the teaching assistant of Mathematical Analysis B1 in autumn semester of 2024(for more, see [Teaching Assistant](https://lyuchangle2006.github.io/TeachingAssistant/)). During 2025 spring semester, I'm now participating in the _Enhanced Program for Graduate Study_ at **BICMR, PKU**.

One can check [Notes](https://lyuchangle2006.github.io/Notes/) for notes that I made(basically hand-written) in various courses and topics. Also one can contact me by email(lcl20060401lcl@mail.ustc.edu.cn) or QQ(2732992857).
