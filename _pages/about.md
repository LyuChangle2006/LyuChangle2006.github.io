I was admitted to $${\color{lime}School \space of \space Gifted \space Young, \space USTC}$$ in 2022 and now I'm also a member of Hua Loo-Keng Talent Program in Mathematics. I have been enjoying my life in USTC @ Hefei, doing things that I love(my major math and other [hobbies](https://lyuchangle2006.github.io/Interests/)). 

Academically I am interested in ***geometric analysis(about geometric flows, Kaehler geometry and symplectic geometry)***. It is also worth mentioning that I spent my sixth semester @ **BICMR, PKU**,  participating in the _Enhanced Program for Graduate Study_.

I usually upload my [notes](https://lyuchangle2006.github.io/Notes/) when learning some mathematics(basically hand-written) to this website. I have been a teaching assistant for the course mathematical analysis (B1) @ USTC in the last two years and one can see the course information [here](https://lyuchangle2006.github.io/TeachingAssistant/). 

One may contact me by email(lcl20060401lcl@mail.ustc.edu.cn) or QQ(2732992857).
