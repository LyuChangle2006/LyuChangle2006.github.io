I'm a second year undergraduate student from [School of Gifted Young](https://sgy.ustc.edu.cn/), [University of Science and Technology of China](https://www.ustc.edu.cn/). I'm also a member of Hua Loo-Keng Talent Program in Mathematics of USTC. My current interest includes many aspects in geometry and topology, such as complex geometry and characteristic class theory.
