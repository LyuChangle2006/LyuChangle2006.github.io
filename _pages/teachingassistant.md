Chapter 1 (Limit)
======
* 1.1  Real Numbers
  * [The conception of countability and uncountability, cardinality of a set](http://LyuChangle2006.github.io/files/1.pdf)
  * [Three ways to construct real numbers: the equivalence class of rational Cauchy sequence, infinite decimal, dedekind cut](http://LyuChangle2006.github.io/files/2.pdf)
  * [Basic definitions about topology on the real line, the sixth axiom on completeness of the real number system: finite covering condition](http://LyuChangle2006.github.io/files/3.pdf)
* 1.2  Limit of a Sequence
  * [Toeplitz's Theorem (generalized Stolz's theorem)](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/29912566?utm_id=0): try to use this to solve Example 1.2.20 from Page 25 and exercise 11 from page 53 in the textbook.
  * [Wallis' Formula](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E6%B2%83%E5%88%A9%E6%96%AF%E5%85%AC%E5%BC%8F/22784701?fr=ge_ala)
  * [Stirling's Formula](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/331906704): exercise 1(4) from Page 25 and exercise 10(2) from Page 53 are direct results from this.
* 1.3  Limit of a Function

  *  [Semi continuous function](https://blog.csdn.net/weixin_45120088/article/details/104263935)
* 2.2 Properties of Continuous Function on a Closed Interval
  *  [Some more properties of continuous function](http://LyuChangle2006.github.io/files/4.pdf)

Chapter 3 (Derivative)
======
* 3.1 Derivative
  * [Everywhere continuous but nowhere differentiable function: Weierstrass function](http://LyuChangle2006.github.io/files/5.pdf)
* 3.2 Differential
