title: "Note for Complex Geometry(NOT COMPLETED)"
collection: publications
excerpt: 'I made this note when learning the video course of complex geometry taught by [Prof. Zhang Xi](https://dsxt.ustc.edu.cn/zj_ywjs.asp?zzid=3631) in 2020SP semester. The video can be found [here](https://tysunseven.github.io/video/Complex%20Geometry%202020S.html). The note is divided into two parts.   <br>
<br>
<br>

  Part I: Introduction to multivariable complex analysis, basic definition of complex manifold and Kahler manifold, connection and curvature, differential operator on complex manifold.   <br>
  Part II: Hodge theory, Chern-Weil theory, sheaf theory and stability of vector bundle, line bundle and vanishing theorem, Hermitian-Einstein bundle, Donaldson-Uhlenbeck-Yau theorem and  Calabi-Yau theorem.   <br>
<br>
<br>
One may refer to "Differential Geometry of Complex Vector Bundles" by Kobayashi for Chapter 1 to 7 of this course. '
