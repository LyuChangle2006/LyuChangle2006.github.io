collection: publications
excerpt: 'This is a brief survey on the problems about Kahler-Einstein metric proposed by Calabi in the 1950s, finally solved by Chen-Donaldson-Sun,Tian in the 2010s. Covering:  <br>
<br>
<br>

  1. Proposed Ricci curvature problem: Calabi-Yau theorem <br>
  2. Existence of KE metric on negative Chern class manifold: Aubin-Yau theorem  <br>
  3. Obstructions of existence of KE metric on Fano manifold: Lie algebra of holomorphic fields- Matsushima Theorem, Futaki invariant  <br>
  4. Functional I,J,F; existence of KE metric equivalent to properness of F(Thm 1.2 in Tian 1997 Invent. paper)  <br>
  5. Alpha-invariant, existnece of KE metric on surface(Tian 1990 theorem)<br>
  6. Generalized Futaki invariant of Ding and Tian, K-energy of Bando and Mabuchi<br>
  7. Ultimate result: existence of KE metric equivalent to K-stability(sketch of proof).

One may refer to the original papers for the results mentioned in the note.'
