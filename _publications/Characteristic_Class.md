title: "Note in Characteristic Class Theory(Ver. 20240728)"
collection: publications
excerpt: 'This note is about characteristic class theory in topology and differential geometry. It basically covers Milnor's book and I also referred to Kobayashi's book in complex vector dundle and Zhang Weiping's book in index theorem for the differential geometry part. It is still very incompleted and under working. Also there are certainly many mistakes. I will upload the newest version here in time.
