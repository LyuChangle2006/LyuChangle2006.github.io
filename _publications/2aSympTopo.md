Covering: <br>
  1. Linear symplectic topology: non-squeezing, affine-rigidity, symplectic width/capacity, Maslov index <br>
  2. Basics on persistence module: definitions, barcode(normal form theorem), isometry theorem, <br>
  3. Floer homology: Hofer geometry, Conley-Zehnder index, (filtered) Hamilton-Floer homology  <br>
  4. Persistent homology: Hamiltonian persistence module, dynamical stability, symplectic persistence module  <br>
  5. Application: symplectic homology, topological stability, proof of a version of non-squeezing <br>
  6. Basics on J-hol curves: definitions, unique continuation, Carleman similarity, critical points and simple curves <br>
  7. Moduli space: Main theorem on moduli spaces, tools used for the theorem(elliptic regularity, transversality), compactness(removal of singularity, bubbling).<br>
One may refer to various books on symplectic topology and J-hol curve by **McDuff** and **arxiv 1904.04044**(for persistence module part) by **Zhang Jun** and others.
