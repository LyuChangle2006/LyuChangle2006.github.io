title: "Note for group representation theory"
collection: publications
excerpt: 'I made this note when reading the book ***Introduction to the representations of groups and algebras*** by **Feng Keqin, Zhang Pu and Li Shangzhi**. This note covers:  <br>
<br>
<br>
      1. Basic definitions in group representation theory, construction of representations, completely reducible and irreducible representations, Schur lemma and Maschke theoren<br>
        2. Character theory, orthogonal property, more on irreducible representations(dimension, amounts), deciding character table, application: Burnside theorem <br>
          3. Basic definitions on modules and algebras, Wedderburn-Artin theorem on semi-simple module/algebra, Jacobson radical <br>
            4. Projective and injective module, absolutely simple module and splitting field, ultimate goal: irreducible character decides irreducible representations <br>
            5. Induced representations, Frobenius reciprocity law, Mackey subgroup theorem and irreducibility of induced representations       <br>
            6. Representations of compact group, Peter-Weyl theorem: applications and proof.
