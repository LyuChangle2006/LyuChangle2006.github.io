collection: publications
excerpt: 'This is a note on Ricci flow, based on the content of the course **Foundations of Ricci flow** taught by [**Prof. Li Yu**](https://sites.google.com/view/yuli21/home). Covering:  <br>
<br>
<br>

  1. Basic definitions and calculations: Ricci flow, variation of tensors, convergence of manifolds and flows, DeTurck trick and short-time existence <br>
  2. Various maximum principles: (Strong) MP of parabolic equation and comparison, MP for tensor, MP for noncompact manifold, MP of system(ODE-PDE theorem)   <br>
  3. Evolution of curvature tensor, high-order estimate of Shi and long-time existence(curvature blow up)  <br>
  4. Curvature Operator: Hamilton ODE, conditions preserved by Ricci flow, Hamilton-Ivey estimate, manifolds of nonnegative curvature operator, Hamilton 1982 theorem  <br>
  5. Nonnegative isotropic curvature, construction of cones, prove of differentiable sphere theorem <br>
  6. Entropy of Perelman, monotonicity of entropy, no-local-collapsing <br>
  7. Solitons and special solutions, geometry at spatial infinity.
